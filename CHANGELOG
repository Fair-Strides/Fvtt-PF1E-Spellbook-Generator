## [2.0.0] - 2022-10-02
  
Updated to v10 for Foundry (odds are I've screwed a few things up or could take lessons to make things cleaner...)
 
### Added

- Added a selection of buttons to modify the spells that have been dragged and dropped. (Why didn't I do that originally?!)
- Buttons allow for selecting or deselecting all spells on the current level, as well as increasing or decreasing level.
- Can open the Spell Browser directly
- Remove spells as needed/desired

### Changed
  
- Shrunk the spells display to take up half the area that it now shares with the buttons.
- Each spell is accompanied by a checkbox to allow you to toggle it for use with button commands
 
### Fixed
 
- Prevented duplicate spells on drop

## [1.0.0] - 2017-03-14
